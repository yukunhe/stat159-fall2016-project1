## **Introduction**

The paper is to introduce the basic steps to do a project and the basic usage of the tools. To work in a project, there are five basic steps. First is to write the content of project in a Markdown file. Users can edit text, create images, create website links and so on in the Markdown file. The usage of Markdown will be discussed further in the discussion part. The second step is to write a Makefile. Makefile is used to combine the components of the project into one final project. Makefile basically is used to set rules to tell Make how to do with the files and the more comprehensive usage of Makefile will be introduced further in the discussion. The third step is to use Pandoc to convert the Markdown file or any other formats into the formats you want. It could be HTML files, pdf and so on. The fourth step is to use Git commands to upload the project to GitHub repository. The fifth step is to check if there's any error in the project and to correct them and update them to the GitHub. In the discussion below, I will comprehensively introduce each step of doing the project and the functions, advantages and commands of each tool. I will also share my own experience on working on a project using those tools.
