## **Abstract**

The paper introduces five computational tools including Markdown, Git, GitHub, Makefile, and Pandoc. The five tools are widely used in the reproducible workflow. In this paper, I will introduce the functions, advantages and the commands of the five tools and I will also share my own experience of using the tools. This paper is to give readers a general idea about the usage of each tool and their role in the reproducible workflow.
